 A genetic algorithm for multivariate optimization written in Python.
 
## Usage
Put `SplittingForContinuousOptimization.py` in your working directory import it 
as follows:
```python
from SplittingForContinuousOptimization import SCO
```

### Example
```python
from SplittingForContinuousOptimization import SCO, peaks
import numpy as np

SCO(S=peaks, N=200, Ï‚=0.8, w=0.5, B=[-3*np.ones(2), 3*np.ones(2)])
```
